# Simscape Electrical Probes

Requires the Simscape Foundation Libraries.

[Add the folder to your matlab path](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html) and refresh the simulink block library. 
[Use startup.m to permanently update your path](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html).

Double click anyway in a simulink diagram and type "ammeter", "voltmeter", or "ohmmeter" (or "[current|voltage|resistance] probe").
